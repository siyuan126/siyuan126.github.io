I think myself as a translator between data and humans. I enjoy solving real world problems with the help of computers and communicating the results in a simple way with my audiences. A life-time yogi, dreamer, and problem-solver. 

### More Information

I am about to finish Metis data science bootcamp and actively looking for a full-time job as data scientist. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any job-related infomation.
