title: How to Communicate Effectively as a Data Scientist?  
---
Let's say you used some really complicated algorithms, built a great model, and solved a very important business problem, when you communicate the results with your boss/coworkers/client, no one can understand it, how would you feel? And probably more important, how would your audiences feel? Do you really think that they will blame themselves for being not smart enough to understand you?

This leads to my first point: __ Communication is never about showing off how smart you are but about making your audiences understand what you say.__ Without their understanding, all the hard work and efforts just don't count. 

So how to make our audience understand us? The advice I can give is that always put your audiences at heart when you deliver your results. Specifically, know their backgrouds so you can carefully choose the language you use. Don't assume that your audiences understand those terminologies, algorithms and models. Instead, assume that they don't know any of them. And now, you need to figure out how to make them understand you without knowing anything of your work.
