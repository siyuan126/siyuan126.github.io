title: How to Communicate Effectively as a Data Scientist?  
---
Let's say you used some really complicated algorithms, built a great model, and solved a really complicated business problem, when you communicate the results with your boss/coworkers/client, no one can understand you, how would you feel? And probably more important, how would your audiences feel? Do you really think that they will blame themselves for being not smart enough to understand you?

This leads to my first point: #### Communication is never about showing off how smart you are but about making your audiences understand what you say.
