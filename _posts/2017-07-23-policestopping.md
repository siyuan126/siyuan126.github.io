title: Demystifying Police Ticketing
---
On a typical day, about 50,000 Americans are pulled over by the police, and nearly 70% of them would get a traffic ticket. Compared to drivers with a clean driving history, people who got tickets in generall pay 11% more for their car insurance. which accounts for about $617 per year. These facts inspire two questions: 1) Can we predict if a driver will get a ticket after pulled over? 2) What factors will affect policer officers' decision during a stopping?

This project aims to gain insights of police ticketing by answering the two questions. The data used is from Stanford Open Policing Project whose goal is s to help researchers, journalists, and policymakers investigate and improve interactions between police and the public. The project collects police stopping data of 31 US states. Each data file is in csv format and pre-cleaned. For different states, the time range of the data is different, as well as the specific infomation. In generall, Stop Date, Stop Time, Stop Location, Driver Race, Driver Gender, Driver Age, Stop Reason, Search Conducted, Search Type, Contraband Found,Stop Outcome
