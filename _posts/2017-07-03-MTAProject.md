## Problem Statement
WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) needs to collect email addresses at subway stations so it can send free tickets to its annul gala. WTWY hopes to use data analytics to help its street team gather most signatures from those who will attend the gala and contribute to its fundraising and other duties.
## My approach to WTWY's request
1. Make assumptions
- There are several assumptions need to be made in order to solve this problem. Here is a list of assumptions and how they affect next steps.

| Assumptions                                    | So what                         |
| -----------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------:|
| WTWY has limited resources                     | Only focus on best options      |
| Signatures collecting happens before annul gala| Data before summer matters      |  
| Annul gala can be hold anywhere in NYC         | Location of gala doesn't matter |    

2. Data Sources
- I use MTA data (April and May of 2016) to get info of subway stations.
