title: Being a Data Scientist 
---
The more I dive into data analysis's world, the more I feel that I am becoming a translator and bridge between data and human world. As a translator, the job goes two directions: I turn the real-world problems into data science problems, feed the problems to computers (where a lot of useful and powerful data tools run), get the results, interprete the results and communicate the results to the target audiences. 

Since the job is to act as the connection between data and human world, it means that I have to know both computers and human world. Sometimes I feel a bit confused, specially when I work with computers, I have to think like a computer, when I work on real-world problem, I have to think like a human being! This kind of role-shifting is challenging and I am still working on better switching between the two ways of thinking. 

As a data scientist, I see the power of computers in solving complicated problems, and even better or worse, they are becoming smarter and smarter.
