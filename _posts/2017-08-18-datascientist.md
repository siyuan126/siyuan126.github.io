title: Being a Data Scientist 
---
The more I dive into data analysis's world, the more I feel that I am becoming a translator and bridge between data and human world. As a translator, the job goes two directions: I turn the real-world problems into data science problems, feed the problems to computers (where a lot of useful and powerful data tools run), get the results, interprete the results and communite the results to the target audiences.
