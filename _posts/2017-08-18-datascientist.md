title: Being a Data Scientist 
---
The more I dive into data science world, the more I feel that I am becoming a translator and bridge between data and human world. As a translator, the job goes two directions: I turn the real-world problems into data science problems, feed the problems to computers (where a lot of useful and powerful data tools run), get the results, interprete the results and communicate the results to the target audiences. 

Since the job is to act as the connection between data and human world, it means that I have to know both computers and humans. Sometimes I feel a bit confused, specially when I work with computers, I have to think like a computer, when I work on real-world problem, I have to think like a human being! This kind of role-shifting is challenging and I am still working on better switching between the two kinds of thinking. 

As a data scientist, I see the power of computers in solving complicated problems and creating value for business, and even better or worse, they are becoming smarter and smarter. A report from Mckinsey claims: "recent advances in robotics, machine learning, and AI are pushing the frontier of what machines are capable of doing in all facets of business and the economy". You may still remember that AlphaGo defeated Lee Sedol,a human champion of the complex board game Go in March 2016. Actually since then, it has beaten up another Go world top player, Ke Jie. A Hong Kong media commented 'It isnâ€™t looking good for humanity'.
